MediaWiki code search! (powered by hound)

We use etsy's hound as the backend for codesearch. The search functionality
is great, but the UI is a bit lacking, so we work around it a bit.

== Setup ==

 sudo apt install docker-engine python3 gunicorn3 python3-flask \
   python3-requests

 git clone https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/labs/codesearch /srv/codesearch
 cd /srv/codesearch
 ./write_config.py
 sudo cp *.service /etc/systemd/system/
 sudo MODE=start ./manage.sh

If that works, then curl http://localhost:3002/ should work, and you can point
a web proxy to that port.

Once you're happy with what is running, you should run
`sudo MODE=enable ./manage.sh` so that the services will automatically restart
upon boot.

== Constraints ==
We don't want to modify or fork hound. Really we just want to use the upstream
docker images without modification. So we use a flask application to proxy
requests to hound, and inject our HTML during that process.
