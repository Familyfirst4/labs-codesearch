MediaWiki code search! (powered by hound)

We use etsy's hound as the backend for codesearch. The search functionality
is great, but the UI is a bit lacking, so we work around it a bit.

== Setup ==
This guide is based on setting up a new instance on the Wikimedia
Cloud VPS infrastructure. Currently we use Debian Buster medium
sized images.

After creating the instance, you should enable the `role::labs::lvm::srv`
puppet class, which will create a separate partition for `/srv`. We then
want to modify the filesystem so we get some more inodes per available
storage. Note that you should disable puppet so it won't interfere.

 sudo puppet agent --disable "messing with partitions"
 sudo umount /srv
 sudo mkfs.ext4 -T news /dev/mapper/vd-second--local--disk
 sudo mount /srv
 sudo puppet agent --enable

Running `df -hi` should show an increase in available inodes. You can
proceed with actually setting up codesearch now by enabling the puppet
role: `role::codesearch`. Then, force a puppet run:
 sudo puppet agent -tv

If you get errors related to iptables and docker, reboot the instance
and they should fix themselves.

You might also need to force hound configuration to be written by running:
 sudo systemctl start codesearch-write-config

If all that works, then `curl http://localhost:3002/` should work, and you can
point a web proxy to that port.

The hound- instances will be automatically restarted by systemd after 24
hours, which will pick up any new config changes.

== Constraints ==
We don't want to modify or fork hound. Really we just want to use the upstream
docker images without modification. So we use a flask application to proxy
requests to hound, and inject our HTML during that process.
